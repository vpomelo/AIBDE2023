                    <p>Yupei Zhang is an assistant professor in the school of computer science at Northwestern 
                    Polytechnical University (NPU), Xi’an, China. He earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer 
                    Science from Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China, in Dec. 2017. From 2018 to 2020, he
                    was a postdoctoral fellow with Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, and Georgia Institute 
                    of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. From 2020 to 2021, he was a postdoctoral researcher 
                    with University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA. His research topics include educational data 
                    mining, learning analytics, big data mining and analysis, machine learning and 
                    optimization theory. He has guided two key projections on educational data mining and 
                    published many scholar papers. He has serviced many conferences and journals as a
                    committee or a PC member. He has co-organized a workshop on advanced education
                    symposium in China.</p>

                    <p>He is currently an assistant professor in UMass, USA. Prior to joining UMass, Andrew 
                    was a postdoctoral research associate in the EDGE Lab, Princeton University, from 2017 
                    to 2018. Andrew was a postdoctoral research associate in the Digital Signal Processing 
                    (DSP) group, Rice University, in 2016, where he received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees 
                    from Rice University in 2014 and 2016, respectively. He also attended the Georgia 
                    Institute of Technology as a visiting student in 2009.</p>
                    <p>Andrew's research focuses on the development of human-in-the-loop machine learning 
                    methods to enable scalable, effective, and fail-safe personalized learning in education, 
                    by collecting and analyzing massive and multi-modal learner and content data. This 
                    massive and multi-modal learner and content data can be collected in both traditional 
                    classrooms and online learning platforms, e.g., during massive open online courses 
                    (MOOCs). His vision is to develop a system that delivers high-quality, affordable, and 
                    personalized learning experiences to every learner in the world. He is also broadly 
                    interested in areas including convex optimization, probabilistic models, machine learning, 
                    and signal processing. He has also co-organized a series of workshops on 
                    machine learning for education; see <a href="http://ml4ed.cc/">http://ml4ed.cc/</a> for details.</p>
